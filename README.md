# Dash & Dine

**Tagline:** "Fueling Love, One Race to the Plate at a Time!"

## Introduction
Dash & Dine is more than just a fitness app; it's a playful celebration of love, competition, and the joy of sharing a meal. Created by a coding couple passionate about running and all things health and fitness, this app is your invitation to embark on a light-hearted, endorphin-fueled journey with your partner.

## How it Works
At the start of each week, you and your partner choose a meal that tantalises your taste buds—a culinary masterpiece that you crave. But here's the twist: the right to savor that delicious dish is up for grabs, and it's all about who can outpace the other on the fitness front.

## Compete & Cook
Throughout the week, engage in friendly competition, whether it's running, yoga, martial arts, or leisurely strolls through the park. The more you exercise, the closer you get to that cherished meal. Keep an eye on your progress as you log your activities; it's all part of the fun.

## Sunday Showdown
The climax arrives on Sunday, the end of your fitness and culinary journey. The person who logs the least activity for the week? They step into the kitchen and become the chef, turning their partner's culinary dream into a reality. It's a showdown filled with laughter, love, and delicious rewards.

## Why Dash & Dine
- Strengthen your bond as a couple through playful competition.
- Stay motivated and active with your partner by your side.
- Enjoy the satisfaction of a well-earned, home-cooked meal.

Ready to embrace a new kind of fitness challenge—one that fills your heart and your plate? Join us on Dash & Dine and turn your love into a delicious rivalry.
